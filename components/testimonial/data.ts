    review: `This is a great app! it's our first time using it tonight & my son loved the book on brushing your teeth. The reader reads the book & the words are highlighted while reading. This helps the children read along & learn the words at the same time. I'm overjoyed over this app it made me extremely happy to see my son's face light up reading along. Thank you to the makers of this app`,

    review: `Best for home schooling. I have tried several apps for my daughter during COVID for her continued education most of them are just noise and distractions and then I stumbled upon this app. The app has great content and calm voices which does not agitate her and she is happy. Must get this if you are serious about education of your kids.`,

It is easy to access. Makes my son occupied and is helping him to increase his knowledge and vocabulary. I would highly recommend it to all.`,
