				<p class="xtext-justify">This Privacy Policy outlines what information is collected through the Site and how that information is used. Smart Kidz Club, Inc. ("Owner") owns and operates the Site. Owner will only keep users' or viewers' of the Site (collectively, "Users" and each a "User") information, which they submit through the Site, for its own internal use.</p>

					<p class="xtext-justify">The Owner reserves the right to revise, change, amend, alter or modify ("Update") this Privacy Policy and its other policies and agreements at any time and in any manner.  The User is responsible for periodically checking for any Updates of this Privacy Policy by re-visiting the Site and using the "refresh" button on the User's browser.

User acknowledges that it is solely User's responsibility to investigate the Payment Processor's policies and to ensure that User is satisfied with the same.  User provides his information to the Payment Processor at his own risk.
